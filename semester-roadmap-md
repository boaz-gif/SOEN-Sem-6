Fully integrated, practical, no-paid-software master plan** that treats this semester like a **training program**, not just classes.

---

# 🧠 MY SEMESTER MASTER PLAN

**Duration:** ~2.5 months (≈10–11 weeks)
**Daily time:** ~6 hours
**Tools:** Laptop + Internet (100% FREE)
**Goal:**

* Pass exams confidently
* Understand concepts deeply
* Apply everything practically
* Leave with usable skills + mini-portfolio

---

## 🎯 THE 6 COURSES (FINAL LIST)

1. **SOEN 302 – Design & Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**
2. **SOEN 308 – Reusable Software Technologies**
3. **SOEN 330 – Software Documentation**
4. **SOEN 380 – Object-Oriented Programming in Python**
5. **SOEN 398 – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Algorithms**
6. **SOEN 315 – Embedded Systems**

Instead of studying them separately, we’ll **pair and stack them intelligently**.

---

# 🔑 CORE STRATEGY (VERY IMPORTANT)

> **One language, one ecosystem, many concepts.**

We’ll use **Python as my anchor language**:

* OOP → SOEN 380
* Algorithms → SOEN 302
* Reusability → SOEN 308
* ML → SOEN 398
* Documentation → SOEN 330
* Embedded → SOEN 315 (with Python-friendly tools)

This massively reduces mental load.

# 🧱 PHASED ROADMAP

## 🔵 PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS (Weeks 1–2)

### Goals:

* Build algorithmic thinking
* Become fluent in Python OOP
* Understand *what each course expects*

### Daily Split (6 hrs):

```
2.5 hrs → SOEN 302 + SOEN 380 (paired)
1.5 hrs → SOEN 308
1 hr   → SOEN 330
1 hr   → Light review / recap
```

### What you do:

### 🧠 SOEN 302 (Algorithms)

* Time & space complexity
* Searching & sorting
* Recursion
* Basic data structures

👉 Implement **every algorithm in Python**

### 🐍 SOEN 380 (OOP in Python)

* Classes & objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation

👉 Implement algorithms as **classes**, not scripts

📌 Example:

```python
class SortAlgorithm:
    def sort(self, data):
        pass
```

This already overlaps **3 courses**:

* Algorithms
* OOP
* Reusability

---

## 🟢 PHASE 2: SYSTEM THINKING & REUSE (Weeks 3–5)

### Goals:

* Think in modules, not files
* Design reusable software
* Write professional documentation

### Daily Split:

```
2 hrs → SOEN 308
1.5 hrs → SOEN 302
1 hr → SOEN 380
1 hr → SOEN 330
0.5 hr → Review
```

### 🧩 SOEN 308 (Reusable Software Tech)

I’ll learn:

* Modular design
* Separation of concerns
* Interfaces & abstractions
* Libraries vs frameworks

👉 Practical task:

* Turn my Python algorithms into a **reusable package**
* Version it with Git
* Write usage examples

### 📝 SOEN 330 (Documentation)

my document:

* Algorithm explanations
* Class diagrams
* User manuals for your modules

📌 By now, i'm already *doing* documentation, not memorizing it.

---

## 🟣 PHASE 3: AI + DATA + ALGORITHMS (Weeks 6–7)

Now my algorithm knowledge pays off.

### Goals:

* Understand ML algorithms conceptually
* Apply them practically
* Explain results clearly

### Daily Split:

```
2 hrs → SOEN 398
1.5 hrs → SOEN 302
1 hr → SOEN 380
1 hr → SOEN 330
0.5 hr → Review
```

### 🧠 SOEN 398 (AI & ML)

* Linear regression
* Classification
* Clustering
* Model evaluation

👉 Implement using:

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn
* Google Colab (FREE)

### Key rule:

**Never just run a model.**
Always:

* Explain the algorithm
* Explain the output
* Explain limitations

That’s exam gold.

---

## 🔌 PHASE 4: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (Weeks 8–9)

This course scares many students — we neutralize it.

### 🛠 SOEN 315 (Embedded Systems)

### What matters for exams:

* Architecture
* Microcontrollers
* I/O
* Real-time constraints

### Practical (NO hardware required):

* Arduino simulations (Tinkercad)
* Raspberry Pi concepts
* Python + GPIO simulation

👉 Example project:

* Simulated temperature sensor
* Data processed by algorithm
* Logged and documented

This ties into:

* Algorithms
* Reusability
* Documentation
* System design

---

## 🔴 PHASE 5: CONSOLIDATION & EXAMS (Weeks 10–11)

### What i do:

* Past papers
* Likely questions
* Diagrams
* Definitions
* Teach concepts aloud

### Daily:

```
3 hrs → Past papers
2 hrs → Weak areas
1 hr → Documentation summaries
```

---

# 📁 My FINAL OUTPUT (This Is Powerful)

By the end of the semester, i’ll have:

* ✔ A reusable Python algorithms library
* ✔ OOP-structured ML projects
* ✔ Embedded system simulations
* ✔ Professional documentation
* ✔ GitHub repositories per course

This is *far beyond* what most students do.

---

# 🧭 NEXT STEP (Important)

 I’ll:

* Lock a **daily timetable**
* Suggest **exact weekly tasks**
* Help build my **first integrated mini-project**
